There once was a dog named Buddy. Buddy loved to explore the outdoors. 
One day Buddy saw a beautiful big yellow butterfully resting on a 
flower. He barked and the butterfly flew into the sky. Excited, Buddy
chased the butterfly across the field. He wasn't watching where he was
going and lost his footing, slipping down a ditch. Night was coming 
and Buddy was lost.
