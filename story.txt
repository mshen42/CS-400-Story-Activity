There once was a dog named Buddy. Buddy loved to explore the outdoors. 
One day Buddy saw a beautiful big yellow butterfully resting on a 
flower. He barked and the butterfly flew into the sky. Excited, Buddy
chased the butterfly across the field. He wasn't watching where he was
going and lost his footing, slipping down a ditch. Night was coming 
and Buddy was lost. 

He tried and tried to get up from the ditch. Buddy explored the ditch, hoping
to find something that he could use. There was a big rock that jutted from the ditch.
He used that rock to climb up to the top. Buddy was able to get up but now he had
to find his way home.
